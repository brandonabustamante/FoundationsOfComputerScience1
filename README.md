## Lab 1.91.1 Convert to seconds

The programming assignment is in C++. The goal is to convert a given input of
hours, minutes, and seconds to seconds only. I will also translate the code 
to Java and Python and add them to the repository.

## Lab 1.20 Basic output with variables
The programming assignment is in C++. The goal is to get practice with basic
input and output. I make use of the power function for better readability.
I will convert this code to Java and Python as well.

## Lab 1.21 Quadratic equation discriminant
The programming assignment is in C++. The goal is to compute the quadratic
equation. I made use of the power function once again for ease of reading.
I will convert to Java and Python for additional practice.
