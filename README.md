# FoundationsIofComputerScience1

This repository contains the lab assignments I completed in my introductory
computer science course in C++. I converted my code to Java and Python for
extra practice.

## Unit 1 Introduction to Programming & C++

Unit 1 features a basic introduction to the C++ programming language.
It covers basic output and variable assignment.
